# Marvim Bot CI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/neovim/bot-ci.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/neovim/bot-ci)

This is the part of Marvim's planet sized brain that runs on TravisCI.
However, you won't find the "Genuine People Personalities" technology here.

# Building Locally

To build locally, execute `./ci/<build script>`, where `build script` is any
executable shell script. Override environment variables as necessary. For
example, to rebuild 64-bit dependencies and push to a `neovim/deps` fork,
execute the following:

```bash
NEOVIM_REPO=<username>/neovim \
NEOVIM_BRANCH=my-neovim-branch \
DEPS_REPO=<username>/neovim-deps \
DEPS_BRANCH=my-deps-branch \
./ci/deps64.sh
```

# Testing PRs

Building of PRs is disabled for this repository; builds would always fail
because of [Travis's security restrictions][travis-security].
You can test your changes in a different way, though. Here's an example on how
to test `neovim/doc`-related changes using Travis CI:

 * Fork the `neovim/doc` repository to `<username>/doc`.
 * Using your `neovim/bot-ci` fork:
   * Enable Travis CI.
   * Create a new testing branch based on your PR branch (e.g. `git checkout
     pr-branch && git checkout -b pr-branch-test`).
   * Obtain a [Github personal access token](https://github.com/settings/applications)
     and encrypt it for Travis using `travis encrypt 'GH_TOKEN=<token>' -r
     <username>/bot-ci`.
   * Modify `.travis.yml` and override environment variables as necessary, e.g.:

```yaml
# ...
env:
  global:
    - DOC_REPO=<username>/doc
    - NEOVIM_REPO=<username>/neovim
    - NEOVIM_BRANCH=my-branch
    - secure: <output of travis encrypt>
# ...
```

After committing and pushing these changes to your PR testing branch, Travis
will perform the build and push the results to `<username>/doc`. If you make
changes to your PR, don't forget to rebase and push your PR testing branch so
that `<username>/doc` will always be up-to-date.

The above steps can be performed analogously for other repositories a `bot-ci`
script pushes to, e.g. `neovim/deps` for `ci/deps64.sh`.

# Nightly builds

Nightly builds of Neovim are generated by a script in this repository and
published at https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/nightly. Currently, they
are only useful to run integration tests against an up-to-date version of
Neovim on Travis CI.

## Setting up integration builds

Neovim provides a script to download and set up a 64-bit Linux nightly on
Travis CI. In the future, it will be extended to support different versions and
operating systems.

To use the script in a Travis build, download and evaluate it in `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
# ...
before_install:
  - eval "$(curl -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neovim/bot-ci/master/scripts/travis-setup.sh) nightly-x64"
# ...
script:
  # `nvim` has been added to `$PATH` by the setup script.
  - nvim ...
```

Evaluating the script will print information about exported environment
variables and the output of `nvim --version` to aid debugging failing builds.

See the [Travis config of the Neovim Python client](https://github.com/neovim/python-client/blob/master/.travis.yml) for a full example.
